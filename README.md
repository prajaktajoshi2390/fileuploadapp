- These APIs are consumed in ReactJS application using Axios.
- These APIs internally call Lambda Functions which perform actual file operations like add/delete/update/download to S3 or DynamoDB.
- Lambda uses IAM role ro restrict user access to the S3 bucket or DynamoDB.
- Lambda uses cloudwatch logs to monitor the appliccation.
- SNS notifications via email have been set for any delete operation on S3 bucket.
- S3 bucket is enabled with versioning, cross region replication, transfer acceleration, event notification, lifecycle policies etc.
